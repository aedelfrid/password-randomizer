# Password Randomizer

## Description

The Password Randomizer will, at the click of a button, prompt for the length and criteria (Uppercase, Lowercase, Special, and/or Numeric Character) of a new password. 

Then validate that at least one criteria is selected and the length is at minimum 8 or at maximum 128 characters.

Next it will generate a password using the criteria. I believe it to be truly random and has equal chance for any criteria being selected for a given character.

Lastly the site will display the generated password in the field above the button.

## Usage

To use the password randomizer, click the "Generate Password" button.

Next input the desired length of the password (at least 8 and under 128 characters).

You will then be prompted for the desired criteria. At least one must be selected.

Finally if all criteria have been satisfied, the password will be displayed in the site.
